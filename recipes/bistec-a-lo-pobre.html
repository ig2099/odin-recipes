        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bistec a lo Pobre is a popular dish in
           South America, though more commonly 
           found in Chile and Peru. The name can
           be roughly translated to “poor man's 
           steak,” even though the flavors are 
           very rich and decadent. Even though 
           the exact origin is unknown, there 
           are a few theories of the meal's 
           history. The leading theory is that
           many working-class citizens ate the 
           meal since it has many proteins and 
           carbohydrates. Since the meal only 
           had a few ingredients, it was also 
           ideal for lower-paid workers.
