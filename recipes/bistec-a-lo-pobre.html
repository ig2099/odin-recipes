        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bistec a lo Pobre is a popular dish in
           South America, though more commonly 
           found in Chile and Peru. The name can
           be roughly translated to “poor man's 
           steak,” even though the flavors are 
           very rich and decadent. Even though 
           the exact origin is unknown, there 
           are a few theories of the meal's 
           history. The leading theory is that
           many working-class citizens ate the 
           meal since it has many proteins and 
           carbohydrates. Since the meal only 
           had a few ingredients, it was also 
           ideal for lower-paid workers.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Thinly Cut Steaks</li>
            <li>3 Onions</li>
            <li>4 Eggs</li>
            <li>4 Potatoes</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>4 Garlic Cloves</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel all of the potatoes then cut 
                them into fries. Soak your fries for
                30 minutes and dry well before frying 
                in hot oil at 360 ℉ (182.22°C).
                Remove the fries when they are golden 
                brown and keep them warm in the oven 
                at 200 ℉ (93.33°C).</li>
            <li>Cook the onions in oil, sautéing them
                until they are a golden brown color. 
                They should also be soft. After they 
                finish cooking, keep them warm in the 
                oven. </li>
            <li>Season the steak with garlic and salt,
                and pepper. If you have a meat hammer,
                flatten the steaks so they're all the
                same size. </li>
            <li>Cook the meat over high heat. 
                Depending on their thickness, this 
                could mean anywhere from three to 
                five minutes per side. </li>
            <li>Fry the eggs in oil. The eggs are 
                traditionally served sunny side up 
                (with a runny yolk). </li>
            <li>Put some onions on your plate, and
                then some fries. Place the steak over 
                top of the onions and fries. Finally,
                top the steak with the fried egg. </li>
        </ol>
