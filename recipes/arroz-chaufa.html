        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Arroz chaufa or arroz de chaufa means 
           Chinese rice.  It's a Peruvian dish that
           was introduced by Chinese Peruvians who 
           had immigrated to Peru between the 1960's
           to late 1990's.  Dishes like arroz 
           chaufa that are a combination of Chinese 
           and Peruvian cuisines are referred to as 
           Chifa.</p>
