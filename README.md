# odin-recipes
This project will contain an index.html page along with links to other pages with recipes.

Today, 8/17/2023 I finished the HTML recipes project with The Odin Project. I have demonstarted the skill of building the structure of webpages and websites. I learned how to write out HTML boilerplate for HTML files. I have also learned to commit and commit often whenever there was any meaningful change.
